# Introduction
The berkeley_dataset contains information about the gender, intended major, and acceptance status for UC Berkeley applicants in the year 1973. This dataset allows researchers to determine if the university is discriminating in its acceptance on the basis of sex.

# Implementation
In the computations_d1.qmd file, I created two side-by-side data visualizations depicting the relationship between city and highway mileage of 38 popular car models - one with respect to the number of cylinders in the car and the other with respect to engine displacement in liters. Juxtaposing these variables enabled conclusions to be drawn about their level of influence on the cars city and highway mileage.

# Results
These graphs resulted in the finding that more cylinders corresponds with worse or lower miles per gallon in these cars.
